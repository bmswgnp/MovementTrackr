This app records inertial data, viz. accelerometer (m/s^2), gyroscope (degrees/s) and GPS information (lat/long, when available) and stores data series in a .csv file. Additionally, data can be corrected for orientation of the phone and stored as well. To use the app, users have to create a profile and pick a particular activity type. One can also add new activities or labels to files. Users can also plot data time series and GPS plots from within the program. We are also working on help menu. The current release is an experimental version and works only on Android 2.3.1 or higher. We look forward to your comments and suggestions to improve the app.

The current version 1.0 is already out there in the market and available to download for free. Please visit the following link:  https://market.android.com/details?id=com.resl.sensors&feature=search_result
